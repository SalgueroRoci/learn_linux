Using Shell Scripts
Are plain text files and begin with:
    
#!/bin/sh : The first two characters are a special code that tells the Linux kernel that this is a script and to use the rest of the line as a pathname to the program thatâ€™s to interpret the script.
For shell scripts you need to modify to be executable using chmod. To run: ./<filename> or bash <filename> or sh <filename>
